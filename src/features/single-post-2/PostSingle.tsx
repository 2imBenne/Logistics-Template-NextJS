                    No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because
                    it is pleasure, but because those who do notknow how to
                    pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are
                    extremely pain- ful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or
                    pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it
                    pain, but because occasionally circumstances.
